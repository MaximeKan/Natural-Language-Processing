        "# How is GPT-2 treating actors and actresses?\n",
        "\n",
        "GPT-2 is an automatic text-generator released by OpenAI in 2019. It is the second version of the \"GPT\" family, standing for Generative Pre-trained Transformer. It is definitely one of the most discussed Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, with its release came astonishment at the overall quality of the text outputs but also concerns over misuse and biases. These biases are well-documented and are direct consequences of the data that was used to train this deep learning beast. The data sources (text from Google, GitHub, eBay, Washington Post etc) contain biases and they are being reproduced by a model that was trained to imitate them. \n",
        "\n",
        "In this post, we will look in particular at gender biases present in GPT-2 using the example of actors and actresses. It is obviously a very difficult task to quantify these biases, our assessment will remain purely qualitative using a couple of input examples. "
