To keep it short, the main advantage is that it should be able to capture semantics by representing each word in a vector space. However, the main drawback is that they require to learn a lot of parameters and a lot of data to do so. Suppose we want to have an embedding size of 32 and 3,000 words in our vocabulary, this implies we will have to learn 96,000 parameters. This is not an issue per se, as a matter of fact, it is still reasonable compared to other mainstream neural networks. However, it means we need a lot of data to train these embeddings accurately.

        "How disappointing! Yes, it does speed up the learning process a little bit, but using these pre-trained embeddings considerably lowers our accuracy. Why is that, although we had seen that these embeddings are able to capture movie semantics quite well while we played around with gensim features?\n",

They aim to be general word representations and hence might be too general here. Also, the corpus used for the training of the GloVe embeddings might not be that well suited for our task. Wikipedia articles, for instance, do not convey much sentiment or opinion. Hence, these embeddings might be less suited to run sentiment analysis.\n",

        "In the model we built above, we used a Global Average Pooling layer right after the Embedding layer. This means we averaged all 500 embeddings of the reviews along each of the 50 embedding dimensions. This is a necessary step because else we would have to connect these $50 \\times 500 = 25,000$ values to the hidden layer, which would result in an explosion of the number of weights to learn and to overfitting. By averaging along each of the dimensions, we aggregate the information into only 50 values, which is much more reasonable.\n",

By computing the average like we did before, we allow these padding embeddings to significantly impact our the model prediction, which should not be the case. Another concern is that we still do not take advantage of words associations like negations. In a review such as \"I did not like it\", the embeddings of each of these 5 words will be averaged and then passed through the hidden layers, but at no point will the \"not\" + \"like\" combination be explicitely evaluated.\n",

        "Essentially, the Convolutional Neural Network will have the same architecture than the previous models with an Embedding layer at the begginning and Hidden Layers at the end. What changes is the addition of the Convolution filtering inbetween, as you can tell from the model summary below. Let us walk through the architecture of this model as before:\n",

        "- First we have the Embedding layer that works the same way as before. After this step, our review is a matrix of size (500,50)\n",
        "\n",
        "- We then add a Convolution layer. Basically, it is a set of weights that computes a rolling weighted average as it scans the matrix along 5 words at a time (this is the kernel_size argument). Naturally, given that each word is represented by a vector of size 50, our convolutional filter scans 250 values at the time. Thus, a filter is composed of 250 weights and 1 bias (251 parameters). Since the filter scans 5 words at a time, it will return a vector of 500-5+1=496 values. This gets repeated for each of the 256 filters. As a result, our output is a matrix of size (496,256), and this layer requires $256 \\times (5\\times50 + 1) = 64,256$ parameters. Once the filter is applied, we also apply non-linearity through the relu function.\n",
        "\n",
        "- As a general rule, a Convolutional layer is followed by a pooling layer to reduce dimensionality. Here, we apply a 1-dimensional MaxPooling with a pool size of 4, which means we are splitting each row of the matrix obtained at the previous step in sets of 4 values and keeping only the maximum. This reduces our matrix from size (496,256) to size (124,256). \n",
        "\n",
        "- Before the next Convolutional layer, we add another Dropout layer, which randomly discards 50% of the values of the matrix to avoid overfitting\n",
        "\n",
        "- We repeat the same Convolutional layer as before. This step requires training much more parameters than the first layer, because the input is bigger this time. The number of parameters can be calculated the same way as before by replacing the original embedding dimensionality (50) by the number of filters in the previous step (256): $256 \\times (5 \\times 256 + 1) = 327,936$. Following the same reasoning as before, the output of this layer will be of size (120,256).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Again, this layer is followed by a MaxPooling layer that reduces the size of the matrix to (30,256).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Eventually, we flatten this matrix to a vector of size $30\\times256 = 7,680$.\n",
        "\n",
        "- We apply another Dropout layer to randomly discard 50% of these values.\n",
        "\n",
        "- This vector is fully connected to a hidden layer of size 128. This results in $7,680\\times 128 + 128 = 983,168$ parameters to train. We then apply the activation function relu.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Finally, these 128 nodes are fully connected to the output layer through the final $128+1=129$ parameters. This output gets converted to the probability of belonging to class 1 with the sigmoid function."
