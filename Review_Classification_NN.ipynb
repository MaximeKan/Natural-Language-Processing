To keep it short, the main advantage is that it should be able to capture semantics by representing each word in a vector space. However, the main drawback is that they require to learn a lot of parameters and a lot of data to do so. Suppose we want to have an embedding size of 32 and 3,000 words in our vocabulary, this implies we will have to learn 96,000 parameters. This is not an issue per se, as a matter of fact, it is still reasonable compared to other mainstream neural networks. However, it means we need a lot of data to train these embeddings accurately.

Basically, it is a set of weights that computes a rolling weighted average as it scans the matrix along 5 words at a time (this is the kernel_size argument). Naturally, given that each word is represented by a vector of size 50, our convolutional filter scans 250 values at the time. Thus, a filter is composed of 250 weights and 1 bias (251 parameters). Since the filter scans 5 words at a time, it will return a vector of 500-5+1=496 values. This gets repeated for each of the 256 filters.

Following the same reasoning as before, the output of this layer will be of size (161,256).\n",
